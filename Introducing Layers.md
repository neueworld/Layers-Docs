Layers is a decentralized freelancing protocol built by freelancers for freelancers. It aims to bring transparency, security, authenticity, ownership, and interoperability to the existing freelance ecosystem so that users can work in the space with more freedom and confidence.

Layers is leveraging public blockchains to bring transparency and control to the freelancing world. 

## Here's how Layers is harnessing the potential of public blockchains to benefits

### **Transparency**

Every transaction and interaction is recorded on a public blockchain. This transparency means the full history of any activity is visible, be it payments, project milestones, or reviews. It's like having a clear, unalterable record book, open for everyone to verify, enhancing trust and clarity in every deal.

### **Control Over Data**

Imagine having a vault where only the owner can decide who gets access. That's what Layers offers. The user has full control over their data - who sees it, and how it's used. Their professional credentials, work samples, and transaction history are theirs to share on their terms, ensuring privacy and security in a digital workspace.

### **Independence and Portability of Data**

Layers recognizes the need for independence in managing your professional data. Just like how NFTs and tokens are not confined to one wallet, the freelancing data – including contracts, payment records, client testimonials, and more – is not bound to one platform. This means it can be accessed and utilized across different services and tools of choice. Users are not tied to a single platform; instead, They can have the freedom to use and share their professional data wherever and however they find it most beneficial. This portability is crucial in the modern freelancing landscape, offering unparalleled flexibility and control over professional footprint.

### **Authenticity and Reduced Fraud**

The blockchain's immutable nature ensures that once data is stored, it can't be tampered with. This solidifies the authenticity of every record on Layers. Whether it's work history, reviews, or payments, the untampered history reduces the risk of fraud, allowing work with confidence and reliability.

### **Permanence and Reliability**

There’s no fear of losing valuable data or work history. The blockchain’s permanence ensures that data stays intact as long as the blockchain exists. The user is not at the mercy of a platform's lifespan; their professional legacy remains secure and accessible, forever.

### **Smart Contracts for Fair and Transparent Deals**

Layers utilizes smart contracts to automate and enforce agreements. These contracts execute pre-defined conditions without any hidden agendas. You get a transparent, decentralized process where terms are clear, payments are automated upon job completion, and disputes are minimized.
