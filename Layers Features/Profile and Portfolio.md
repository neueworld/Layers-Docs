# Profile and Portfolio

## Profile

A profile on a platform is a user's personal digital space that contains their identifiable information, preferences, and activity specific to that platform. A freelancing profile mainly contains the basic information of a user, past/current work information, and client testimonials. 

The platforms that work primarily with databases or centralized storage providers have quite straightforward methods to let users view or update the data which is a great advantage of using these platforms but on the other side users only have virtual control over data, anyone access to the database can update it.  

The Data on decentralized networks can be updated by the owner only and it is not easy to directly view or update them like centralized ones because the data can be encrypted for privacy so the proper permission from the owner is required to view them and to update the data, transactions needs to be sent to the blockchain network from the users. 

Providing full control and making a smooth user experience is very challenging.

Layers Profile encapsulates the user data from decentralized sources like IPFS or public blockchain networks and provides a user interface on the **Layers app** to view, update, or share the data. Layers ID is being used as the identifier for the user profiles. 

Layers Profile contains data related to the jobs, payments, and reviews. Layers maintains a balance between the decentralized networks and databases, whatever data points are responsible for the on-chain reputation they need to go on the decentralized network, and data points to provide a more personalized experience are stored inside databases. 

## Portfolio

Layers encapsulates the data stored on decentralized networks and transform them into a portfolio that can downloaded and shared with others. Itâ€™s similar to the resume but it lets the viewer verify the claims, For example, if there is a developer resume and it has a section on programming languages or tech stack, the portfolio also embeds the proofs alongside them which helps the view to verify them. 

The data of the portfolio is stored on a decentralized storage network which makes itâ€™ accessible universally without depending on any platform.

**The Portfolio has been currently implemented for,**

### Developer

The Developers can connect their GitHub accounts and import the data. Layers structurizes the data, generate necessary proofs, and arrange them for the portfolio in different sections.

### Designer

The Designers can Import the Figma designs through the Layers Figma Plugin and create their portfolio.

ðŸ’¡ The Current Implementation of the portfolio uses the data from third-party platforms such as GitHub and Figma.
