Layers only asks for read-only data from third-party apps, it never writes anything there. The portfolio aims to provide the viewers with concise information to understand and necessary verification links while saving their precious time while freelancers can focus on their work not creating and maintaining the portfolio. Eg: If a viewer is looking at the developer portfolios they would be able to see their basic details (name, email, socials), Languages, tech stack/Frameworks, Consistency, and repos and can verify each of them from GitHub. For the Designer Layers has a plugin to enable the smooth import of designs.",
