# Layers ID

Every platform needs user identification. When a user wants to use a platform they create an account that holds all their data, for example on X (formally Twitter) when an account is created it gives a unique handle to the user, and data such as posts, likes, and comments are associated with the account. The handle becomes the primary identification on the X and user data can be viewed by searching it on the platform.

Web3 has a major challenge with user identification because the primary identifier for a user is a wallet address which looks like 0x725b35D35eDE4157ebE5a57613609d40C4DB6aB7.

The wallet addresses are hard to remember and not user-friendly. 

Layers provides a solution for its ecosystem which is **Layers ID**. Layers ID is a decentralized identity solution that uses Soul-bound NFTs as the base infrastructure to create a user profile on Layers. It provides a unique handle to each user and all the data generated on the Layers are connected with the ID. It helps users maximize work opportunities and gives them control over their work data on Layers.

ðŸ’¡ Every handle on Layers ID is unique.
