# Jobs

Layers jobs are the place where the users make money by applying to posted jobs. Layers Job section is the core of the product because it provides a user with ways to earn. Layers jobs use contracts by default, smart contracts to enforce the payments, cryptographic signatures for proofs, and decentralized storage to build an on-chain experience.

## Feature of Layers Job

### Universal Job Liquidity

The current freelancing jobs ecosystem is isolated, jobs inside one platform can be accessed outside of it which leads to *fewer opportunities* for freelancers and *limited talent* for clients.

We want to build an open job market where anyone can fetch job information through Layers’s open API so the jobs aren’t just limited to Layers App. Users outside the Layers ecosystem can have access to it, and apply for it. Other communities can provide their member the opportunities to earn.

### Default Contracts

Every job has a default contract which can contain from basic job descriptions to complex contracts. The data of contracts is stored on the decentralized storage networks with both parties’ signatures which makes sure the data is unalterable and can be used as the source of truth at any point in time.

### Smart contract Intergation

Smart contracts run on public blockchain networks which provides them advantages such as decentralized execution, and immutability and they can be used for designing logic that is enforceable, some popular use cases are *escrow* and *proof-of-action.*

## Layers Job Posting

The Clients will be able to post the jobs through the Layers app when the application will be launched.
